A simple example of using spark, in java, to convert csv file to another csv file

More precisely, the constraint is that each line can be converted independently.
Also, the output are part files such as produced by map-reduce.

This example is made to run locally.
See [this](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.1/programming-guide.html#initializing-spark) for more details
